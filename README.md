##Specific comments by A. Dias

This project creates a simple weather app to check temperature and wind speeds for the day and others at an hourly rate using [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/). It was created following the requirements requested on the README file in the [glitch.com project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/join/87a60099-ec88-4f85-868b-2701a4de0742).

While for the most part I was able to work with the editor provided, I unfortunately got stuck when it was time to proxy the open weather app api server, since glitch.com was provided with an invalid server header error when I produced the proxy. Thus to access the api a change to this repo was needed and unfortunately for the user to view this app they should follow the instructions bellow.

Of note before following the below instructions, the user must first make sure to `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure the most up to date packages are being used. Specifically [material ui](https://material-ui.com/) and [react-weather-icons](https://github.com/williamsb/react-weather-icons) are dependencies that must be installed.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
